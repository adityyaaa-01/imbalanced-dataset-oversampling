# Imbalanced Dataset Handling with Over-Sampling

This project demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets using the **RandomOverSampler** technique from the `imblearn` library.

## 📌 What’s Inside?

- Visual exploration of class imbalance
- Balancing data using `RandomOverSampler`
- Training a classification model (Logistic Regression / others)
- Visualization of class distribution before and after over-sampling

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imblearn`

## 📊 Sample Output

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Before Oversampling | Shows skewed class distribution |
| After Oversampling | Shows balanced class distribution |
